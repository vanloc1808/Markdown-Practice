## Lightweight Markup Language
There are several lightweight markup languages that are **supersets** of
Markdown. They include Grubder's basic syntax and build upon it by
adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting,
URL auto-linking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown
applications use one of the following lightweight markup languages:

- [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.com/gfm/)
- [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
- [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)
