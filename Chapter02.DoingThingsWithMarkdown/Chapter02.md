# Things that Markdown can do
## Websites
If we are looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files,
check out blot.im and smallvictori.es.  
After signing up for one of these services, they create a Dropbox folder on our computer.  
Just drag and drop Markdown files into the folder, and they will appear on our website.  
If we are familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out Jekyll, a popular static site generator
that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website.  
One advantage to this approach is that GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites.

## Documents
Markdown is not as good as Microsoft Word for processing words, but it is good enough for creating basic documents
like assignments or letters.  
We can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML. 
For example, Visual Studio Code has an extension named "Markdown PDF" for this usage.

## Notes
In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes.

## Books
Lookint to self-publish a novel? Try Leanpub, a service that takes your Markdown formatted files and 
turns them into a electronic book, outputs in PDF, EPUB and MOBI file format.

## Presentations
Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files.  
Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it,
it is a lot faster and easier than using an application like Powerpoint or Keynote.  
Remark (GitHub project) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as is Cleaver (GitHub project).

## Emails
There is an easy way to write email messages using Markdown.  
Markdown Here is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text
into HTML that is ready to send.

## Documentation
Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are
increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation - check out their blog post about
how they migrated their Markdown-formatted documentation to Jekyll.
