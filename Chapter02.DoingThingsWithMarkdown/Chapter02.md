# Things that Markdown can do
## Websites
If we are looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files,
check out blot.im and smallvictori.es.  
After signing up for one of these services, they create a Dropbox folder on our computer.  
Just drag and drop Markdown files into the folder, and they will appear on our website.  
If we are familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out Jekyll, a popular static site generator
that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website.  
One advantage to this approach is that GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites.

## Documents
Markdown is not as good as Microsoft Word for processing words, but it is good enough for creating basic documents
like assignments or letters.  
We can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML. 
For example, Visual Studio Code has an extension named "Markdown PDF" for this usage.
